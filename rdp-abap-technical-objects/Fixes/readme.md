      * New version for User guide has been updated with details on the features introduced

### **Update: V6.0.4 â€“ August 12th 2025**:

      ### âœ¨ Features added
      
	* Catch Weight materials - optional
		- Introducing a new application parameter allowing customers to make optional the catch weight 	materials during delivery replication 
		- By default, the value of the application parameter is empty (false), meaning the quantities in base unit of measure will be used. 
		- Packaging compositions in RDP are defined either in the product base unit of measure or in one of the alternative UoMs that can be converted to the base UoM. Therefore, catch weight quantities are not relevant for RDP (RDP needs the quantity in the base unit of measure).
		- Unless there is a specific business reason to send catch weight materials to RDP, the quantities in the base unit of measure should be sent.
