      ### 📘 Documentation
      
      * New version for User guide has been updated with details on the features introduced

### **Update: V6.0.4 – August 12th 2025**: 

      ### **TR 901435.BP7** 

      ### ✨ Features added
      
	* Catch Weight materials - optional
		- Introducing a new application parameter allowing customers to make optional the catch weight 	materials during delivery replication 
		- By default, the value of the application parameter is empty (false), meaning the quantities in base unit of measure will be used. 
		- Packaging compositions in RDP are defined either in the product base unit of measure or in one of the alternative UoMs that can be converted to the base UoM. Therefore, catch weight quantities are not relevant for RDP (RDP needs the quantity in the base unit of measure).
		- Unless there is a specific business reason to send catch weight materials to RDP, the quantities in the base unit of measure should be sent.

### **Update: V6.0.7 – October 2025**

	### **TR 901481.BP7**

	### ✨ Features and Fixes

	* **Material documents replication report**
	  - Adjust the logic for determining the ShipToCountry attribute, to correctly handle cases where a receiving vendor is maintained on the corresponding Purchase Order

### **Update: V6.1 – December 2025**

	### **TR 901524.BP7**

      ⚠️ **Important Note – Impact on Pack Fee Replication Report**

      A new mandatory selection parameter **Load ID** has been introduced for Delta Load execution in the **Packaging Fee Retrieval** report.

      * Existing scheduled background jobs for “Retrieving Pack Fee – Delta Load” **will fail** unless batch jobs are updated to include this new parameter.
      * Customers must **update their job variants** and verify the selected Load ID.
      * Customer-specific **BAdI implementations**, especially those enhancing retrieval or posting logic, may require adjustments to align with the updated report logic.

      It is highly recommended that customers review their automation and BAdI code before importing this update to avoid interruptions in replication processes.

      ### ✨ Enhancements & Fixes

      * **Packaging Fee – Retrieving & Posting Reports Adjustments**  
        The RDP Pack Fee API now supports multiple delta tokens in parallel.  
        Major functional enhancements include:
        - Allow customers to maintain **separate delta runs per variant**
        - During initial load, the variant name is stored together with the delta token
        - Delta load must be executed **per variant**
        - Retrieved data is saved and archived
        - Added option to **post retrieved data directly** from the same report (via radio button)

      * **Handling Unit Report Adjustments**
        - Fix for correct handling of the entity mapper class

      * **HTTP Protocol Version – Updated Logic for JSON Header**
        - SM59 configuration now determines whether HTTP 1.0 or HTTP 1.1 is used when replicating data to RDP
        - System automatically sets correct protocol version in HTTP requests

      * **Determination of BOM Valid-To Field – Plant Added to Sorting Attribute**
        - Ensures BOMs assigned to multiple plants appear correctly  
        - Fix implemented without impacting existing customer BAdI logic

      * **Material Document – Country Determination Priority Update**
        - Implemented logic for prioritizing **country of target customer**  
          (relevant for drop shipment scenarios)

      * **Packaging Fee Reports – Added Missing Authorization Objects**
        New authorization objects introduced for:
        - Customer Role
        - Company Code Exemptions
        - Customer Exemptions

      * **Delivery Report – Fix in Package Splitting**
        - Adjustment in the package-splitting logic, in case BAdI is implemented

      * **Bug in Example Implementation – Material Classification Fraction Mapping Versioning**
        - Fix for missing **VERP** material in BOM processing
        - Corrections in BOM where-used determination when components have no assigned material
        - Includes performance improvements

### **Update: V6.1.1 – January 2026**

	### **TR 900528.M19**

	### ✨ Features and Fixes

	* **Delivery documents replication report**
	  -  Adjusted the logic to correctly send all objects split across multiple packages. Previously, objects starting from the second package were not sent.  
	* **Packaging element from material classification report**
	  - Fixed a short dump caused by an unassigned field symbol.    

### **Update: V6.1.2 – February 2026**

	### **TR 900529.M19**

	### ✨ Features and Fixes

	* **Support for Packaging Composition Variants**
	  - Packaging Data Reports – Support for Packaging Composition Variants
 		 Adjustments were implemented to include additional variant-defining attributes:
  		  - productionPlant
  		  - plant
  		  - shipToParty
 		  - distributionChannel
 		 These attributes allow more accurate replication of packaging composition variants across different operational contexts.

	- Batch Report – Enhanced Support for ProductionPlant
  		The Batch replication report has been updated to handle the ProductionPlant attribute (as part of characteristics data), enabling improved data consistency and alignment with upstream manufacturing processes.
